**Source codes for various projects!**

1. Fault Tolerant Hierarchical FUSE File System:

  This project consists of expanding on the vanilla version of the flat in-memory FUSE file system. Firstly it was made into a hierarchical namespace to mimic modern systems. Then, various features like persistent storage, data auto-correction and caching were added. Fault tolerance was implemented by replicating the data on a user defined number of servers. 

2. Sample Hello, World program:

  This is just sample program. Thats it! 


Stay tuned for updates and the addition of new projects.
